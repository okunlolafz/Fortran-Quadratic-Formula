## **Description:**
The Simple Quadratic Equation Calculator is a Fortran program designed to calculate the roots of a quadratic equation. The user is prompted to input the coefficients (a, b, and c) of the quadratic equation in the correct order. The program then calculates the discriminant and determines the nature of the roots (real, complex, equal, or unequal). Finally, it displays the solutions for the quadratic equation.

## **Usage:**
1. Run the program by executing the provided Fortran code.
2. Input the values for coefficients 'a,' 'b,' and 'c' when prompted.
3. The program will calculate the roots based on the input values and display the solutions.

## **Note:**
- Ensure correct order of coefficients (a, b, c).
- The program handles both real and complex roots.
- In case 'a' is zero, the program identifies and reports the equation as undefined.

## **Example:**
```fortran
This is a simple program calculator for Quadratic Equation
Input the values for a, b, and c below in the correct order:
1  -3  2
Solution of the quadratic equation:
x1 = 2.0000000
x2 = 1.0000000
```

## **About:**
The Simple Quadratic Equation Calculator is a basic tool for calculating solutions to quadratic equations. It was created as part of a Fortran programming exercise and is open to further customization or improvement.
